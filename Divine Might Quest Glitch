Steps To Reproduce / any other info: Party traded La'Loff Amphitheater to port for BCNM,CS started for player who had never done it before
,fight started for those who had completed already.Party cleared fight before one member was out of the initial cutscene (Xcaliber).
Upon completion all members were given a black screen. After teleing out of black screen, party did not recieve credit for completion.
Party attempted to re-enter, no prompt was given at BCNM portal,party disbanded and attempted to use another player's Ark Pentasphere.
The portal would not accept Amphitheater and refused to initiate BCNM fight even after several zones and relogs.
